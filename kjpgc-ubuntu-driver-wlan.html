A few days ago I got a Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition. I thought it would be a good alternative to a MacBook. The reason I have used MacBooks the last four or five years, is that they are "just working". But now I figured I could use Ubuntu on a laptop and it would also be "just working". Because that's what I heard from Dell's marketing and various reviews. However, I can't say that it really lives up to my expectations.

This is my first post on this platform and it is a matter that is quite perplexing for me. So for the sake of background, back in 2014 I purchased a Dell Inspiron 3537 with 8 GB RAM, an i7-4500U, an AMD HD 8850m, etc. etc. All was well and good until the summer of 2018, when my GPU suddenly stopped working and as a result, I couldn't even get past the Windows login screen. Thinking that the GPU was fried, I uninstalled the drivers for the AMD and used the built-in.
